# Nar: Cloud Deployment, Simplified

**Nar** abstracts away deployment complexity, letting developers focus on building features. Whether you prefer the simplicity of a user interface (UI) or the power of automated CI/CD, Nar ensures you can deploy professional-grade applications to AWS with ease.

## The Nar Philosophy

Nar is built on the principle of **True Ownership**, ensuring everything runs in your own AWS account—you own the code, the data, and the infrastructure. With **Zero Lock-in** (including Nar itself), you can build with Nar without being trapped by proprietary dependencies, relying instead on clean cloud architecture. Nar provides **Expertise on Tap**, allowing you to deploy complex stacks like Lambda, CloudFront, and secure Data Layers with professional-grade configurations by default.

## What Nar Delivers

Nar handles the "heavy lifting" of cloud deployment so you don't have to. The **Intuitive Control Panel** provides a user interface (UI) for managing sites, environments, and deployments with a single click. For teams, Nar is **CI/CD Ready**, seamlessly integrating into automated pipelines for consistent, reliable releases. 

You can jumpstart your project with **Curated Verticals**, which are production-ready features like Google OAuth or Subscription payments. Best of all, Nar provides **Automated Cloud Infrastructure**, provisioning and connecting the AWS resources required to run your application so you can focus entirely on your code.
