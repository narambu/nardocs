# AWS Context

The **Context** section establishes the professional permissions required for Nar to deploy your [vertical](vertical.html) to AWS.

## Initializing Your Account (Init)

Before you can build on AWS, your account needs to know that this project is authorized. If this is your first time deploying this project to a specific AWS account, simply click **Init**.

This is a one-time "handshake" that grants Nar the permission to create and manage the professional-grade resources your application needs. Once done, you're set for all future deployments on this account.
