# Data Storage

Behind every great application is a reliable place to store information—from user profiles to file uploads. In Nar, this is your **Data Layer**.

## Setting Up Your Infrastructure

When you start a new site, your storage resources don't yet exist in the cloud. Clicking **Setup** commands AWS to build the actual data resources and file buckets your application needs.

You generally only need to run this once per environment. Nar handles the complex configuration and security settings, ensuring your data is stored in a scalable and best-practice architecture.
