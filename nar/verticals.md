# Verticals

A [vertical](control-panel/vertical.html) is code and configuration that solves a business use case, deployable to AWS via Nar. Nar provides production-ready **Verticals**—complete application stacks for common business use cases.

## Vertical Selection

You can have multiple verticals installed in your library.

- **Activate**: Pick a vertical from the dropdown and click **Activate**. This switches your focus to that vertical. **Note**: If this is your first time using this vertical in this project, clicking Activate will also unpack the code files into your folder.
- **Import**: If you have a new package file (`.nar`), click the **+ (Import)** button to add it to your library.

## Available Verticals

- **[React Auth Lambda](../verticals/ral.html)**: Modern React + Google OAuth.
- **[Paddle Payments](../verticals/ppay.html)**: Subscriptions and customer management.
- **[Auth Service](/verticals/common/auth.html)**: Shared backend auth service.
