# Your Workspace

Your workspace is the local directory where Nar manages your projects and configurations. Understanding the [Structure](workspace/structure.html) is essential, as Nar is built for a multi-project experience where each folder represents a specific vertical.

### Choosing Your Workspace

When you first launch Nar, you'll be prompted to select your workspace folder. This is the root directory where all your vertical projects and `nnet/` configurations will be stored.

The heart of your customization lives within the **[nnet/ Configuration](workspace/config.html)** directory. This folder contains the vital instructions Nar uses to bridge your local code with the cloud.

### Master Your Config
Manage how your services are mapped via **[code.json](workspace/code-json.html)**, connect your professional brand with **[domains.json](workspace/domains-json.html)**, and ensure your identity is consistent at the root of your domain with **[apex.json](workspace/apex-json.html)**.
