# Workspace Structure

A Nar workspace can contain multiple projects. Each project is known as a **Vertical**.

In your workspace folder (e.g., `/Users/mirasvali/wsnar/`), each sub-folder represents a vertical:

```text
wsnar/
├── ral/        <-- Vertical project folder
└── another-app/ <-- Another vertical project folder
```
