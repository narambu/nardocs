# Environment Variables

Nar generates environment variables for both services and the UI at build time. See the relevant section for details:

- [Service Environment Variables](service-environment-variables.html) — variables available to Lambda functions at runtime
- [Vite Environment Variables](ui-environment-variables.html) — `VITE_` variables available to React code via `import.meta.env`
