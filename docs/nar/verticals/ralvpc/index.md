# React Auth Lambda VPC

Same as [React Auth Lambda](/nar/verticals/ral) but with Lambda functions running inside a VPC. This vertical demonstrates the [`network` configuration](/nar/workspace/nnet/code-json/composites/services-lambda#network-configuration) for private networking.

**[Getting Started](/nar/verticals/ralvpc/getting-started)** — Configure auth, VPC, and deploy.

**Includes:**
- **[React UI](/nar/verticals/ralvpc/ui)** — Frontend built with React 19, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
- **[Auth Service](/nar/verticals/common/auth)** — Python Lambda running inside a VPC with Google OAuth login and session management.
