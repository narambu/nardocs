# Composites

A **composite** is a bundle of cloud resources that Nar provisions and manages together, typically paired with default application code. Your [code.json](/nar/workspace/nnet/code-json) declares which composites a [vertical](/nar/verticals) uses — only what's declared gets created.

Nar currently supports [AWS Composites](/nar/composites/aws).
